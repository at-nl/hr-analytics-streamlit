# HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
> Streamlit app deployment via Heroku

This repository contains the source code for deploying a predictive Machine Learning [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web app on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline

The related [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wgcFwe3gOGRgZP6OH8naS0NpIc1tVwSU?usp=sharing#scrollTo=LxzdsFwLVb9x) contains an extensive analysis of the data, preprocessing pipeline, model-building procedure, and Streamlit app development.

## Data
The HR Analytics dataset is available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists). A company is interested in understanding the factors that may influence a data scientist's decision to stay with a company or switch jobs. This allows the company to "reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates."

## About Streamlit, Heroku, and Google Colab
Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.

Google colab notebooks allow users to combine executable code and rich text in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more.
